In the "ip" repository, multiple commits were made to improve the code by following Java coding standards, providing JavaDocs for all classes, and ensuring compatibility with Java 11. Other changes include adding new valid dates, moving classes into packages, refactoring Duke to use new classes, and adding various levels of functionality such as handling errors, saving, marking tasks as done, adding and listing tasks, and renaming, greeting, and exiting the program. Gradle support was also added, and the README.md document was tweaked to better fit Duke's user guide.
