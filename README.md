## What we do
Coolprofiles creates a *cool* README for your GitHub profile, so you can easily showcase to everyone what you've been up to recently.

## Setting up

‚ùó If the repository does not share your username, the README will not display on your profile.

2. Setup environment variables. Copy the environment variables from .env.sample and fill in your [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) and [OpenAI key](https://www.maisieai.com/help/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key-for-chatgpt).
